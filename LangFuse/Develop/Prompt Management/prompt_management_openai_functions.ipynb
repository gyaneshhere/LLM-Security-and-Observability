She became a benevolent spirit to the less fortunate, the homeless people who equally shared the cold nights with her.

No one could see her, yet her actions spoke volumes, turning her into an unsung hero in the hidden corners of the city.\n",

Joy started to kindle in her heart, born not from the invisibility, but from the result of her actions; the growing smiles on the faces of those she surreptitiously helped. Whisper might have remained unnoticed to the world, but amidst her secret kindness, she discovered her true happiness.\n",
